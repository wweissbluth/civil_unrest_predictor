# First Attempt

This `v.1` is my first attempt at predicting civil unrest. It started very convergent, with a very simple formulation, and then it divereged quickly as I considered new features or better label engineering, and utlimatley it became too combersome and distracting, dealing with all the divergence. 

I created `v.2` to return to a meaningful MVP, taking into account all the assumptions & charcteristics of the data that I ignored the first time I completed this model. The idea here is to thoughtfully, and succinctly generate a model in `v.2`

I might then create a better more accurate / meaningful model in `v.3`, then I might productize this all and host it online for a `v.4` - we'll need to see if this project every gets that far.
